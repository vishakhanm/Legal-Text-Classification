Chang signed the fraudulent returns as Didsee\u2019s President. \u00a0 \u201cOwners can\u2019t use their businesses as piggybanks, paying personal expenses out of their corporate accounts and falsely claiming them as business expenses,\u201d said Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg. \u201cAll employers are legally required to file accurate and complete returns and pay their fair share \u2013 just like their employees.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cThis case was not about a mistake or a misunderstanding, it was about greed,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Michael T. Batdorf of IRS Criminal Investigation (CI). \u201cTracy Chang agreed to help her son, Howard Hsu and his business cheat the IRS. Hsu fabricated millions of dollars in expenses and Chang knew the expenses were false. She maintained the books and signed the tax returns while Hsu gave the CPA the \u201ccooked books\u201d. In today\u2019s economic environment, it\u2019s more important than ever that the American people feel confident that everyone is playing by the rules and paying the taxes they owe.\u201d \u00a0 A sentencing date has not been scheduled. Hsu and Chang face a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison for the conspiracy count and three years in prison for the false return counts. Hsu and Chang also face a period of supervised release, restitution and monetary penalties. \u00a0 Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg and U.S. Attorney Stretch thanked special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Colin Sampson and Trial Attorney Matthew Kluge of the Tax Division, who are prosecuting the case. \u00a0 Additional information about the Tax Division and its enforcement efforts may be found on the division\u2019s website. \u00a0"

WASHINGTON \u2013 A federal grand jury in San Francisco returned an indictment against the current president of HannStar Display Corporation for his participation in a global conspiracy to fix prices of thin-film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panels, the Department of Justice announced today.   The indictment, filed today in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, charges that Ding Hui Joe, aka David Joe, conspired with others to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing the prices of TFT-LCD panels. Joe, a resident of Taiwan, is charged with participating in the conspiracy from on or about Sept. 14, 2001, until on or about Jan. 31, 2006.   TFT-LCD panels are used in computer monitors and notebooks, televisions, mobile phones and other electronic devices. By the end of the conspiracy period, the worldwide market for TFT-LCD panels was valued at $70 billion. Companies directly affected by the LCD price-fixing conspiracy are some of the largest computer and television manufacturers in the world, including Apple, Dell and Hewlett Packard.   According to the one-count felony charge, Joe participated in the conspiracy by agreeing to fix prices of TFT-LCD panels during secret meetings, referred to as \"Crystal Meetings,\" in hotel rooms in Taipei, Taiwan. The participants in the conspiracy also exchanged information on the sales of TFT-LCD panels for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed-upon prices. According to the court document, in order to keep the meetings secret and avoid detection, the participants took various steps to conceal the conspiracy.   As a result of this investigation, more than $890 million in criminal fines have been obtained to date. Including today\u2019s indictment, 22 executives and eight companies have been charged in the department\u2019s ongoing investigation into price fixing in the LCD industry.   Joe is charged with price fixing in violation of the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine for individuals. The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.   An indictment contains merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.   Today\u2019s charge is the result of a joint investigation by the Department of Justice Antitrust Division\u2019s San Francisco Field Office and the FBI in San Francisco.   Anyone with information concerning illegal conduct in the TFT-LCD industry is urged to call the Antitrust Division\u2019s San Francisco Field Office at 415-436-6660 or visit www.justice.gov/atr/contact/newcase.htm."

"U.S. Files False Claims Act Complaint Against Western New York Contracting Company, Two Owners and an Employee
The United States filed a complaint against a Western New York contracting company, and its owners and an employee, alleging that they submitted false claims for federal contracts intended for service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, the Department of Justice announced. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Buffalo, New York, against Strock Contracting, Inc., Lee Strock, Kenneth Carter and Cynthia Ann Golde, who are alleged to have defrauded the government by falsely claiming eligibility for millions of dollars in contracts being awarded by the Air Force, Army, and Department of Veterans Affairs intended for service-disabled, veteran-owned (SDVO) small businesses. Strock largely owns and manages Strock Contracting, Inc., and Strock and Carter were officers and partial owners of Veteran Enterprises Company, Inc. (VECO), which was awarded the contracts. Golde was a former employee of VECO. \u201cCongress established the Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned contracting programs to provide economic opportunities for veterans with service-connected disabilities and to help them participate in federal contracting and compete in the American economy,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division.\u201cThe Justice Department is committed to making sure that only eligible companies participate in these types of federal contracting programs.\u201d \u201cThis country long ago developed policies designed to ensure that our wounded warriors have the ability to participate in government-funded programs, and to have their transition into the civilian economy eased to the extent possible,\u201d said U.S. Attorney William J. Hochul Jr. of the Western District of New York.\u00a0 \u201cThis lawsuit \u2013 the first of its kind in this District \u2013 sends a strong message that this office will vigorously protect programs designed to aid those who have already given so much in the honorable service of their country.\u201d Between 2008 and 2013, VECO obtained millions of dollars in federal contracts offered by the government to legitimate SDVO small businesses. The defendants won these contracts after claiming that VECO met all the requirements to be an SDVO small business. The government\u2019s complaint alleges that VECO did not meet the requirements and was not entitled to such contracts.\u00a0\u00a0 In particular, the government alleges that VECO was a sham business whose day to day operations were controlled by Strock Contracting and the individual defendants.\u00a0 For example, the government\u2019s complaint alleges that the purported owner of VECO did not even have a key to VECO\u2019s offices, which were located in the same building as Strock Consulting.\u00a0 The civil complaint is the result of an investigation by the Civil Division\u2019s Commercial Litigation Branch, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of New York, the Veteran\u2019s Administration, Office of Inspector General, Northeast Regional Office; the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division Command, Major Procurement Fraud Unit (MPFU); the FBI; the Small Business Administration\u2019s Office of Inspector General and Office of General Counsel and the Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service.
